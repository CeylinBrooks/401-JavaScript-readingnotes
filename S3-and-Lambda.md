and the software and databases that run on those servers.

What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, 
libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to 
run it, bundled into one package

What is bandwidth?

The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.

How do cloud providers compute service costs?

When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. 
They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. 
These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

Server Instances- a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance

Containers-  a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its 
dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

Cloud Services- refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. 

Cloud Architecture- refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. 
engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems

AWS- Amazon Web Services

EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku -

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is an Infrastructure as a Service product, 
and is Amazon’s flagship offering. Before we’re able to deploy an application on Elastic Compute Cloud,
we have to develop server infrastructure that will suit our application.

Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product based on AWS,
and is vastly different from Elastic Compute Cloud. It’s very important to differentiate 
‘Infrastructure as a Service’ and ‘Platform as a Service’ solutions
as we consider deploying and supporting our application using these two solutions.
