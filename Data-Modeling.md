Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development: 
[Link](https://www.codica.com/blog/test-driven-development-benefits/)
1.Better program design and higher code quality
2.Code flexibility and easier maintenance
3.Save project costs in the long run

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
When the process you utilized needs to initilize certain data and remove it when the test are completed. 

What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
The test suite itself has to be maintained; tests may not be completely deterministic.

Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

Why REST?
REST makes efficient use of bandwidth


functional programming- a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.

object-oriented programming (OOP)- a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.

class-  creates a new class with a given name using prototype-based inheritance.

super- keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.

this- refers to the object it belongs to.

Test Driven Development (TDD)-  a process of modifying the code in order to pass a test designed previously.

Jest- JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

Continuous Integration (CI)- is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day.

REST- an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web. ( GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Data Model- an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
