*Write the following steps in the correct order:*
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Make a request to the access token endpoint
Receive access token
Receive authorization code

What can you do with an authorization code?
an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.

What can you do with an access token?
the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user.

What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.

Client ID-  a unique identifier for a browser.
Client Secret- a secret known only to your application and the authorization server.
Authentication Endpoint- authentication mechanism used to verify the identity of a network's external or remote connecting device.
Access Token Endpoint- the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user.
API Endpoint- one end of a communication channel.
Authorization Code- an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.
Access Token- used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API.
