## How to Solve Programming Problems

- The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a
programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.

- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  
- Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

1. Read the problem completely twice!!(Or 3-4)
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
!As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

Solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you 
really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.

Are you focused, making tangible action steps towards what truly matters?
…Or are you just “busy?”
