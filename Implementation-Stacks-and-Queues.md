Y'all top is the top is the top of the stack (Crazy information to process I know! :)). 

Im going to use an analogy as if I were a worker at the Pillsbury biscuit packing company.

*peek* is looking to see if there any biscuits (Nodes or items) in your container(stack). If there are biscuits present then you can see the amount or value of 
them but if not you say "oh no, its empty!" then thats when the manager *IsEmpty* comes in and confirms "Yes its empty! (true)

or "There are some biscuits (Nodes or items) in there (false). 

*push* is similar to when they PACKAGE (or add the existing container) the biscuits. 

Then finally, 

*pop* is when you smack those packaged biscuits on the counter to remove them for the container (stack).
