## Ethics in the workplace

The article I read was caled "The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of" and it was an interesting read. It is interesting to me the things that people will do
out of  fear. Fear of repartion or the loss of a job based. I feel as though the author of this article was apprehensive about writing the code for the quiz, 
that yeilded the same answer, he did not challenge it out of fear. HE felt as though what he was doing was wrong but continued to do what he felt unethical because 
he as afraid of ricking he boat. I think that as a people we should challenge things that we feel arent right. He did join an organization that tries to combat this type 
of behavior in the end!

## Ethics in Technology 

This article brought a new perspective on the self-driving cars. I hadnt thought about the evausive maneuvers that a smart car might have been programmed to do. It
Almost leads me to beleive that the developers dont have as much regard as they could because of hte options listed as the only options for saving the parties involved 
the ar accident. It is scary to me to think that advances in technology could mean a regression in human decency.
