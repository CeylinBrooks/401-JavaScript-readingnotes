Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

*Express Gateway* is an API Gateway that can sit at the heart of any microservices architecture,
regardless of what language or platform you’re using. Express Gateway secures your microservices and exposes 
them through APIs using Node.js, ExpressJS and Express middleware.

*Amazon’s API Gateway* is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, 
maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
